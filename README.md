# Yandex Mail @ Desktop

This is unofficial and in any case unaffiliated electron wrapper around Yandex.Mail.

## Rationale

After using Yandex.Mail for almost a year I realized that there is absolutely no mail clients that can replace Yandex.Mail interface as it is pretty fast and nice. And sadly I failed to google already existing wrapper.

## Disclaimer

This wrapper isn't affiliated or connected or whatever with Yandex LLC. I'm not their employee. This wrapper was initially created for me and my wife.

## Installation

``yarn`` must be installed.

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

To "just start" the wrapper:

```
yarn start
```

To build package:

```
yarn build
```
