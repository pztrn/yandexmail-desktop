# Yandex Mail @ Desktop

This is unofficial and in any case unaffiliated electron wrapper around Yandex.Mail.

## Rationale

After using Yandex.Mail for almost a year I realized that there is absolutely no mail clients that can replace Yandex.Mail interface as it is pretty fast and nice. And sadly I failed to google already existing wrapper.

## Disclaimer

This wrapper isn't affiliated or connected or whatever with Yandex LLC. I'm not their employee.
